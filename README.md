# Project trybeWallet
This app is the result of an evaluation process during my journey through the trybe course.

## Objectives

* Create a simple app with react and redux.

* This app needs a login page and a page to manage expenses.

* If there is an attempt to enter the expenses page the app needs to render a message saying you are not logged in, to log in click here.

* by clicking "click here" redirect to login page.
